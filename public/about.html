<h1>About Me</h1>

<img src="../assets/images/me.JPG" height="200" alt="">

<p>I am a web developer! Well.. I'm learning to be a web developer and I'm living into that title. I am studying and committing my time
everyday to gain knowledge, skills, and experience in this feild. I really enjoy it!
</p>

<p>I feel confident that I will be of great value and service in this industry. I am self-taught and I am learning by doing two Udemy 
  bootcamps. I thought the contrast between two differet instructors would be good. I am looking forward to getting to work collaboratively
  with a team and continue to learn and grow with a company soon. 
</p>

<p>When I am not learning coding, I am on an adventure somewhere. Probably hiking, biking or kayaking. I also love to travel, take
  photographs of nature and animals. I live for food, basically, I think of food every unoccupied second.
